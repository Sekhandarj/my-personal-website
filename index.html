        <img src="FC7tzWoXIAUDcHp.jpeg" alt="night stroll" class="center2">
        <h3>I like this painting because it conveys a mood, it gives a feeling of a slow sunday evening on a rainy day, something about that atmosphere is very calming to me.</h3>
        <h2>Felicia Chiao "Untitled"</h2>
        <img src="d7hftxdivxxvm.jpeg" alt="anxiety" class="center3">
        <h3>This is another piece of art I found on IG, I'm a huge fan of Felicia Chiao, all of her art is in this style and it's a very unique style, I interpret this image as looming anxiety and how certain anxious feelings can literally feel like a monster looking for you at times</h3>
